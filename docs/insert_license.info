------------------ INSERT LICENSE ------------------

Guidelines for 'insert_license' script:
--------------------------------------------
- The main objective of this script is to insert the license text(header
  comments) to the source/header files without letting the developer/programmer   copy and paste it in each new source/header file being created.

- Another advantage for the use of this script is when the programmer
  forgets to put the license text while creating a new source/header file,
  in which case the programmer doesn't have to put the license text later
  manually.

- There is nothing complex to do for using this script. Just remember the
  following points:
  1. The file LICENSE.comment must be available and must be in the same
     directory as the script.
  2. The content of LICENSE.comment is nothing but the license text.
  3. Run the script by passing the source/header filenames as the arguments.

NOTE: Currently this script works only for C/C++ type of header comments.
      So kindly note that you cannot use this script for programming languages
      that uses comment syntaxes other than C/C++, C#, or Java.
      Don't worry!!! This will be solved soon.
