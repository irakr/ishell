***************** LIST OF TODOs **********************

Overviews:

1) Make a module for the 'cd' command.
2) Make a module for changing PS1,PS2 variable values.
3) Make a module for parsing scripts.
4) Make a module for executing in-built commands. Eg: cd,exit, etc.
5) Make a module for managing shell and environment variables.

Details:

1) Module for 'cd' command:-
The module for the 'cd' command should do a directory change for the terminal.
See the documentation for the 'cd' command and write the codes for each type of
'cd' command. For eg: # cd ..	//Go to parent directory of the current dir.
		#cd -	//Goto the previous directory
		#cd	//Go to the home directory of the user
The module should work for both absolute and relative paths.

2) Module for PS1,PS2:-
PS1 variable can be changed by the user whenever wanted. So whenever the user
enters the command 
	#PS1=<some-string>
then call the change_ps1() function.
See documentations for PS2 variable and implement. Implementation will be similar.

3) Module for shell script parsing:-
	[TO BE IMPLEMENTED]

4) Module for executing in-built commands:-
After parsing the input command, if the command is found to an in-built command, then some action has to performed manually for that. This is
because in-built commands are not the part of the system(or separately installed programs), they are the parts of the shell itself.
Eg: exit, cd, etc...
Therefore, we cannot do a fork-and-exec to those commands.

5) Module for managing shell and environment variables:-
