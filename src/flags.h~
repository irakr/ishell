/*
 *	USAGE OF THIS FLAG
 *	(Similar to linux file permission flags, except here we use hexadecimal conventions)
 *	Here, different flag values can be bitwise ORed using the operator '|' to combine more than one behaviour of a command.
 *	Unfortunately, all combinations are not allowed here.
 *	Possible combinations of flag values are:
 *	 -> (REGULAR_CMD | SINGLE_CMD): Indicates that the command is a regular type(eg: ls,pwd,fdisk,sudo,etc.) and no pipe is applied.
 *	 -> (REGULAR_CMD | PIPED_CMD): Indicates that the command is regular and piped to more than one command.
 *	 -> (REGULAR_CMD | BKGROUND_CMD): Indicates that the command is regular and will run in background without letting the terminal wait.
 *	 				This can also simply be considered as BKGROUND_CMD only.
 *	 -> (INBUILT_CMD): Indicates inbuilt command like: exit,cd,etc.
 *	Any other combinations(or even single values) other then mentioned above will have no effect, i.e, the command will be simply neglected.
